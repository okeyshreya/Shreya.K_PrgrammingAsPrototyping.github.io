        <h1>How to Play?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The main motive of this game is to make sure your character touched the point in the maze within the timer limit.</p>
        <p>We made sure we added RIT building floor map as it is a new building in our campus and many of us have no idea about what the classrooms are and where theyâ€™re located.</p>
        <p> Hence, we made an interactive map with the names of all the rooms and also made sure students can have fun with it by playing it.</p>
        <p>When the mouse is pressed, the character goes back to its restart point.</p>
        <p>When the Up, Down, Left or Right arrow buttons are clicked, the character moves accordingly.</p>
        <p>Hope you guys have fun playing this game!</p>
